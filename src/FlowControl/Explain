 primitive data types : int, char, boolean, byte, double, float, etc..
 defined in the System class (built in) , can not be declared as null
 they have a defined length and you can use them without defining there size.

 methods -> datatypes -> defined by scope

 non-primitive data types -> user-defined data types eg String, Array, Class, Objects etc..
 they can be null, do not have a fixed length, you do not need to provide the length

 Wrapper classes ->  Integer, Character , Boolean, Byte ---> StringBuilder

Scope -> local , global
local - is inside a code logic
global defined in the class as a class member
